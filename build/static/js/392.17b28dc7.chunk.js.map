At that time, there were significantly\r\n        fewer courses and tutorials available online, so I embarked on a\r\n        self-learning path using all available online resources. These efforts\r\n        helped me land a job at a small start-up company, where I joined a\r\n        fantastic team of young and ambitious people. In the first few years, I\r\n        worked on-site in the office in Sofia, but for the last 5 years, I have\r\n        been working fully remotely, which has greatly improved my skills in\r\n        self-discipline, focus, and organization.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Throughout the years, I have worked on a wide variety of projects, which\r\n        has allowed me to gain a broad understanding of different technologies\r\n        and approaches. However, this also meant that I couldn’t focus on\r\n        mastering one specific technology. I have worked on tasks such as:\r\n      </p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>Bug detection and fixing</li>\r\n        <li>Testing functionalities (QA)</li>\r\n        <li>Optimizing mobile design for existing websites</li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Reusing existing modules with new content for a project for a\r\n          well-known automotive brand\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Completing a project on WordPress and building small one-page websites\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>Creating Newsletters</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The first major challenge for me was participating in a long-term\r\n        project, which took me to training in Germany. The project used TYPO3 –\r\n        a CMS platform primarily popular in Germany, the Netherlands, and\r\n        France. Although this technology wasn't entirely my preference, I\r\n        managed to gain valuable lessons and significantly strengthen my\r\n        relationships with the team.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        After this project, I worked on simpler websites based on JavaScript,\r\n        CSS, and HTML, where the focus was on pixel-perfect and responsive\r\n        design. These projects also gave me some basic skills in Photoshop.\r\n        During the pandemic, I started my first project with React – a system\r\n        for reporting technical issues in office buildings, which was a\r\n        significant challenge for me. Besides my basic knowledge of React, I had\r\n        to quickly adapt to working with Material UI and transforming functional\r\n        components into class-based ones.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        After a 2-year maternity break, I returned to a React project related to\r\n        a van ordering system for a well-known car brand. Rewriting the\r\n        integrated 3D Siemens Viewer from JavaScript to React was a key part of\r\n        my tasks. My projects have mainly been based on JavaScript (mostly\r\n        jQuery), CSS (Sass, Less), and HTML, focusing on design precision and\r\n        responsive functionality.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        In the past year and a half, my focus has been primarily on React, with\r\n        a few exceptions. I also have experience integrating REST APIs into\r\n        React projects, using HTTP methods for retrieving, sending, and updating\r\n        data via fetch and Axios.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        My role has typically been as an executor, working in teams of 2-3\r\n        people, with a lead responsible for the project's overall architecture,\r\n        task distribution, and code reviews. In some of the projects I have also\r\n        communicated with clients regarding specifics on the tasks. During the\r\n        years I have worked in Scrum teams. Have experience using tools like\r\n        Jira and Figma. In all projects, I’ve used Git for version control and\r\n        resolving merge conflicts.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        As a person, I am positive, adaptable, and calm, I work well in teams,\r\n        and I am also responsible and motivated for professional development.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <Link className=\"back-link\" to=\"/\">\r\n        Back <img className=\"back-arrow\" src={backArrow} alt=\"Back arrow\" />\r\n      </Link>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default AboutMe;\r\n"],"names":["_jsxs","className","children","_jsx","Link","to","src","backArrow","alt"],"sourceRoot":""}
